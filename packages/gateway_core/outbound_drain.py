"""Shared drain loop for the cross-process gateway outbound queue.

Each gateway adapter (weixin, feishu, discord, ...) runs a long-lived worker
that pulls rows for its adapter_id off the queue and hands each row to the
adapter's own send primitive. Without this shared helper every adapter would
grow its own near-identical ``while running: claim; send; complete`` loop. That
is exactly the kind of bug surface the unified outbound queue was built to
prevent.

Two worker shapes are offered so adapters can pick whichever fits their
existing lifecycle:

- ``run_outbound_drain_loop`` (async): a coroutine that can be awaited as a
  sibling asyncio task inside an adapter's existing event loop. Best when the
  adapter already has an async primary loop (weixin's iLink poll, discord's
  discord.py gateway, dingding/wecom's WebSocket).

- ``run_outbound_drain_thread`` (sync): spawns a daemon ``threading.Thread``
  and returns it. Best when the adapter's main loop is synchronous or is owned
  by an external SDK we cannot re-enter (feishu's ``lark.ws.Client.start``,
  feishu's wsgiref HTTP callback server). The sender callback is sync and can
  issue blocking HTTP calls directly.

The sender callable is adapter-specific (weixin's ``_send_ilink_message``,
feishu's ``_send_outbound``, discord's REST helper). Everything else — claim /
release / complete / backoff — is owned by this helper so all adapters share
one reliability story.

    Semantics:

    - Every ``poll_interval_seconds``, call ``queue.claim(adapter_id=..., limit=claim_limit)``.
    - For each claimed row, call ``await sender(row)``. On success, ``queue.complete(row_id)``.
    - On exception, ``queue.release(row_id, error=...)`` so the queue's built-in
      backoff + max-attempt logic takes over.
    - Exit cleanly when ``is_running()`` becomes ``False`` — the caller is expected
      to wire this to the adapter's own running flag so ``stop_gateway`` can
      unwind the drain task the same way it unwinds the primary loop.

    The helper never swallows ``asyncio.CancelledError`` — cancellation propagates
    up so cooperative shutdown works. All other exceptions either come from the
    sender (in which case the row is released and the loop continues) or from
    the queue itself (in which case we sleep and retry, logging once per poll
    cycle so a permanently broken disk doesn't spam the log).

    Design note: we keep a separate sync entry point instead of bridging to
    ``run_outbound_drain_loop`` via ``asyncio.run``. An adapter whose main
    dispatch is sync (lark SDK, wsgiref) should not have to spin up its own
    event loop just to drain a queue — that adds surprise cancellation and
