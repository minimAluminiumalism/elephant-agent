"""Volatility-based temporal policy for Personal Model facts.

Each fact carries a `volatility` annotation in its metadata that determines
how it ages:

- permanent:    Never decays. Identity, core preferences, personality traits.
- situational:  60-day half-life. Current job, city, active projects, life phases.
- ephemeral:    14-day half-life. This week's mood, short-term plans, recent events.

The freshness score combines:
- Time since last access (or commit if never accessed)
- Access count as a reinforcement signal (frequently used facts decay slower)
