"""Resume support for parked long-horizon loops.

Phase 1 implements the three idempotency locks that a wake-up path
needs before it can safely feed a resumed Loop back into the kernel:

1. **Pending tool calls** — Each tool call registered via
   :meth:`LoopCheckpointService.register_pending_tool` carries a status
   (``dispatched`` / ``running`` / ``done_unread``). The resume path
   inspects each pending entry. If a completed ``Step`` already exists
   for that tool call, the replay is skipped (the tool result is
   already durable). Otherwise the entry is queued for replay with
   its stored idempotency key.
2. **Partial assistant** — If the Loop parked while mid-stream SSE was
   interrupted (see ``ProviderSSEIncompleteError``), the accumulated
   text lives in ``LoopState.partial_assistant``. Resume consumes it
   once and clears the field so a subsequent crash does not re-emit
   the same prefix twice.
3. **Context bundle** — Phase 1 simply records the bundle id the
   checkpoint was last associated with so the caller can invalidate
   caches; full Phase 3 work will lift the typed EpisodeContinuityPacket
   into the rebuild path.

The concrete runtime behaviour (actually calling a provider again,
actually reassembling a ContextBundle) lands in commits 6 (supervisor)
and Phase 3 (continuity packet). This module provides the pure logic
the supervisor can import without bringing the whole kernel service in.
