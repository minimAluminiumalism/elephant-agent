# Web Search

Use this built-in skill when a task needs fresh public-web discovery instead of local repo retrieval.

## Core rules

- Search the public web only when the answer depends on external or up-to-date information.
- Prefer targeted queries and trustworthy sources over broad speculative browsing.
- Summarize what the search changed about the answer instead of dumping raw result noise.
