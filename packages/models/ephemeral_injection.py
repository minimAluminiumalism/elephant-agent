"""Per-turn ephemeral context injection for outbound user turns.

## Why this module exists

Elephant Agent has two context-delivery layers to the model:

1. **Stable prefix** — system prompt + earlier role-preserved history. This
   stays byte-identical across turns so the provider's prefix cache keeps
   hitting. The kernel persists it as `ContextBundle.prompt_envelope.messages`
   and it is the single source of truth for session history.

2. **Turn recall suffix** — a short support section
   produced once from the current user's query. It is appended to the current
   user message after the user's text, then persisted as part of that same
   user turn. When the turn becomes history, the provider prefix remains
   append-only and cacheable.

## The rule

Live runtime recall must not create a second synthetic user turn. Recall is
runtime-added context inside the same user-role message as the user's request,
placed after the request so the authored text remains the lead signal.

## Turn-scoped caching

The kernel may call `model_provider.generate()` multiple times for a single
user turn:

- a **tool loop** fires one initial call plus one follow-up per tool
  observation round, all sharing the same inbound user message;
- a **provider-overflow retry** compacts the context and re-runs the turn.

Re-running affinity/focus builders on each of those calls would (a)
waste latency and cost, (b) feed the follow-up calls a `prompt` argument
that is no longer the user's original query (it becomes "Continue the same
turn…"), which would corrupt the current-turn signal. We solve both problems with
`TurnScopedPrefixCache`: the composer keys ephemeral blocks on
``(episode_id, last_user_message_content)``. A new user turn always changes
the key (because the new turn's last user message is different), so the
cache evicts itself naturally — no TTL, no explicit invalidation.

## The shape

- `ephemeral_blocks_as_user_suffix(blocks=...)` returns the concatenated
  recall/focus blocks without manufacturing a message.
- `append_ephemeral_suffix_to_last_user(messages, blocks=...)` rewrites only
  the last user message into `user text\n\nCurrent-turn recall support:\n- ...`.
- `TurnScopedPrefixCache.resolve(...)` drives builders once per turn and
  returns the same block tuple on subsequent calls inside the same turn.
- `safe_call_block_builder(builder, *args, **kwargs)` centralises the
  try/except pattern every builder needs: a degraded memory/skill subsystem
  must never block the actual model request.
## Where this module MUST NOT reach

- No kernel imports — we want this to be pure.
- No storage writes — everything here is in-memory, request-scoped.
- No logging of block content — blocks can contain sensitive recalled
  memory and are strictly short-lived to the active request.
