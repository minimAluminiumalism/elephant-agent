# System Design

This directory stores the managed product-facing architecture for `elephant`.

The canonical design fact for the cognition and continuity model now lives in
the two system layer documents below. Older design drafts, graph-heavy target
architecture notes, and plan-shaped design documents were removed so new ADRs,
plans, task cards, and implementation docs can be rebuilt from one source of
truth.

## Current Inventory

- [system-layer-model.md](system-layer-model.md)
  - the canonical Understanding System model for Personal Model claims,
    Evidence, Questions, Episodes, Elephant State, and Steps
  - the canonical prompt boundary for active claims, current-turn recall support, and
    Episode opening resume snapshots
  - the canonical claim-aware search contract for `tool.personal_model.search`,
    including exact / semantic / verify modes, query variants, no-match status,
    and diagnostics
  - the canonical removal boundary for memory-note, component taxonomy,
    State task fields, and SkillAffinity-style adaptive skill ranking

## Usage Policy

- treat `system-layer-model.md` as the current product-facing system design truth
  in this directory
- rebuild future ADRs, plans, design notes, and implementation docs from the
  layer model instead of resurrecting deleted historical drafts
- keep this directory for product and system design, not contributor workflow
- keep product-facing setup and onboarding language aligned with the shipped
  runtime under `README.md` and `apps/site/`
- keep operator-facing web references aligned with the shipped dashboard under
  `apps/dashboard/`
